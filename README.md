# Django admin and extra informations

The console admin can be used for data insertion and modification at the following link:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
Maximum care has to be taken since the action performed in the console admin can
lead to inconsistent state of the database especially for the creation of new users and
their authentication.
It is possible to access to the server using the admin through the previous url, inserting
the following credentials:

● Email address: admin@gmail.com

(all the registered user has admin as password to simplify testing)
